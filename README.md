*Anonymous, decentralized email. Powered by IPFS, quorums, and end-to-end encryption.*

## ‚ú® Why Emittio?

> A next-gen email protocol designed for privacy, resilience, and full user control.

We‚Äôre building a mail system that is:

- üï∏Ô∏è **Decentralized** ‚Äî no central servers, no single point of failure  
- üîê **End-to-end encrypted** ‚Äî only sender and recipient can read the content  
- üë§ **Anonymous** ‚Äî no metadata linking IPs, addresses, or messages  
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Efficient** ‚Äî fast delivery, minimal cost

## üß† Architecture Overview

| Component        | Role                                                       |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IPFS**         | Stores encrypted message blobs                             |
| **Smart Contracts** | Handles decentralized user registration and key anchors |
| **Nodes**        | Relay encrypted content across the network                 |
| **Quorums**      | Act as replicators and pin important data for reliability  |

> üì¶ Messages are encrypted and chunked, then routed via multiple nodes using quorum consensus and replication strategies.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] **Step 1**: Anonymous delivery via 2-node relay (Tor-like structure)  
- [ ] **Step 2**: Quorum layer with rotation, replication, and caching  
- [ ] **Step 3**: Smart contract-based identity/key registration  
- [ ] **Step 4**: Fully functional, privacy-focused web client
